# Smart-Mirror
In this assignment, our group used the the gmail, google maps, google calendar finance, quote and weather API along with Firebase Authentication to create a Smart Mirror that renders a users information onto one screen. The Smart Mirror calls multiple APIs and uses JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the mirror to update on intervals.
